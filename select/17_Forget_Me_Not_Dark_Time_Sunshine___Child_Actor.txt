We don't care, we don't trust,
We don't like, we don't love,
We don't touch, we won't harsh,
We talk shit, we don't discuss,
We won't last, we move too fast,
We move too slow, we are a no,
We're not close, we're not together,
We're not friends, there's no hope.
We go out, we split the shower,
We hold hands, there's no draw,
We live life, we love life,
We stay up, we, all night,
We at the club, we at the bar,
We at home, we at the park,
We perfect match, we soul mates,
Heaven and Hell must be fake.

I think it's good, I think it's good, I think it's good,
Could you forget?
Forget your reason, we all need to party with something good
For you to say I need you.

Steady in it, circle the wire end,
That say your name, my darling,
Go ahead and use that pen.
Or you don't have the heart?
Sister to mister Timmy.
Empty your torso always,
Valentine bloody hand
That you were holding me it,
Still pumping gasoline.
Do you get verbals and shit
Venge with that barboline.
Send in your carpatine crisaline to me if you say no
It's still as easily writing that origami note.

Say you need this,
I've been careless.

I think it's good, I think it's good, I think it's good,
Could you forget?
I think it's good, I think it's good, I think it's good,
Could you forget?
I think it's good, I think it's good, I think it's good,
Could you forget?
I think it's good, I think it's good, I think it's good...
The vengeance set you free.

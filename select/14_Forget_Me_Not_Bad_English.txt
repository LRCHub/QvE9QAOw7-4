Although I'm tired of dreaming
I'll imagine once again
Forget me not
No I'm leaving
But who's waiting around the bend
Skip a stone
No they're streaming
While another one bites the dust
Skip again and I'm bleeding
And I'll run from dawn to dusk

So what's the longitude
I'm flying out day to day
"Hey watch your attitude"
I'm running out of clichés

Running thin while believing
You're just waiting for the sign
Confidence is too deceiving
"You're simply too benign"
What is it I'm retrieving
Have you even thrown the bone
The prom queen is disbelieving
She's dancing all alone

"Show some gratitude"
Should I fall back into line
Painting platitudes
Or just sketching the outlines

Yes I'll keep believing
While I'm waiting for the sign
Perhaps I'm only dreaming
But that beats counting time
Tomorrow I may be bleeding
As we stand at the "stand-still"
Forget me not yes I'm leaving
But I'm shooting for a thrill

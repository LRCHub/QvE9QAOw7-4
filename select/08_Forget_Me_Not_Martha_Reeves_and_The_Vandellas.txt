Now we kiss goodbye
You'll be off to war, the battle's on
I don't wanna cry as I stand
And watch your ship sail on

Now when you're out to sea
And the sky is dark and water surrounds you
And your heart just won't be 'cause you feel
As if our loneliness will drive you

Forget me not, boy
Let my love comfort you
Comfort you and see you through
Forget me not, boy
Lock my memory in your heart
And we'll never be apart

Remember Old Joe's
Our favorite song, our table for two
Well, heaven knows, these little things
I'll share with no one but you

Wherever you are, no land
And sea and time will divide us
No matter how far, back to each others arms
Our love's gonna guide us

Forget me not, boy
Write a letter every day
Don't throw my picture away
Forget me not, boy
Let my love within you burn
I'll be here when you return

Each night I will pray for peace on earth
Goodwill to all men
And my little heart will say these tender words
Time and time again

Forget me not, boy
Let my love within you burn
I'll be here when you return
Forget me not, boy

Lock my memory in your heart
And we'll never be apart
Forget me not, boy

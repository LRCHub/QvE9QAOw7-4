I could be everything, but right now I'm not anything
And I'll stitch my eyes shut, I just want them to remember me
Remember me, –member me, yeah
Yeah, I just want them to remember me

Me and Zain up counting stars
Looking through the folds in my brain, where does it start
My brain is cute, it's full of scars
Cover up with bows in my hair just like the dolls
Memorise your features all by heart
Resident angel, I hold my harp
Humming in the subway car, it's a call to arms
I don't know where we are

I could be everything, but right now I'm not anything
And I'll stitch my eyes shut, I just want them to remember me
I could be everything, but right now I'm not anything
And I'll stitch my eyes shut, I just want them to remember me

Just want them to remember me, yeah
Yeah, I just want them to remember me, remember me

Ooh, running around
On my train home back from the town
But my head is loud and I won't turn it down like
Ooh, don't make a sound
I'm rising up in the sky and I'm watching from the moon
And I don't wanna get back down

I could be everything, but right now I'm not anything
And I'll stitch my eyes shut, I just want them to remember me

(Everything) Just want them to remember me, yeah
(Eyes shut) Yeah, I just want them to remember me

We've come so far
It's a message from the stars
If you believe it in your heart
Just remember from the start
We've come so far
It's a message from your heart
And it's written in the stars
Just remember who you are
Water forget-me-not

Giving the fairy a tooth
Weaving my heart in the loom
How could I ever forget you?
That's what I thought everyone had to do
Cut out my heart and give it back to you

Everything, but right now I'm not anything
And I'll stitch my eyes shut, I just want them to remember me
I could be everything, but right now I'm not anything
And I'll stitch my eyes shut, I just want them to remember me

That's what I thought everyone had to do
Just want them to remember me
Cut out my heart and give it back to you
Remember me, remember me
